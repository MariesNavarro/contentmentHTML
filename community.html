        We partner with leading human emotion, psychology,

        and <b><a href="http://ei.yale.edu/" target="_blank">Yale University</a></b>
        to conduct cutting-edge research on indestructible human wellbeing.
        We’re also building powerful and transformational interventions for schools

        at the <b><a href="http://academy.bt/" target="_blank">Royal Academy in Bhutan</a></b> as a primary resource of inspiration
        for many of our new international materials.

        <p>
          <b>The National Science Foundation (NSF)</b> is an
          independent federal agency created by Congress
          in 1950 to promote the progress of science,
          advance national welfare, and to secure the
          national defense. NSF supports basic research
          and people to create knowledge that transforms
          the future. The NSF supported our earliest
          work in documenting contentment as a universal
          human emotion before we were even a foundation,
          a project which yielded two of the largest
          cross-cultural human emotion studies in human
          ever published.
