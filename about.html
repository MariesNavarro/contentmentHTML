            <span>What is contentment?</span>
            <br><br>
            We have heard an endless number of things that we
            should do to maximize our happiness – but why is
            it that in the pursuit of happiness, it always seems
            to be just outside of our grasp?
            <br><br>
            When we desire happiness, we are usually looking for
            more of something – more money, more friends, more time,
            and more success. Our current ideals of happiness depend
            on constantly having more, which is neither sustainable
            nor possible. The great news is that for over 5,000 years,
            our ancestors have been focusing on contentment, a feeling
            of completeness and enoughness with what is present right now.
            <b>Contentment</b> is a sustainable form of wellbeing, just like solar
            power is a sustainable source of energy.
            <br><br>
            In short, <b>contentment</b> is a kind of happiness that comes from the
            inside, not the outside. Contentment means feeling complete and
            whole just as we are, regardless of what’s going on around us.
            It’s a feeling of unshakable peace that no one can take away from
            you - and that no one can give to you either.

            <span>Why does Contentment matter?</span>
            <br><br>
            At the deepest core of human wellness is a sense of profound
            contentment, and uncovering it for yourself is your birthright.
            <b>Contentment</b> is a central theme in some of the most influential
            spiritual, philosophical, and scientific works in ancient and
            modern history. It is what most people really mean when they
            talk about true 'happiness'.
            <br><br>
            In fact, when our team searched through the world’s greatest
            philosophies, we found that contentment was referenced a lot -
            but happiness rarely came up. Over and over again, our team
            piled up the evidence that contentment was what most of us
            are looking for, and that happiness was only a distraction.
            Even scientific studies - dozens of them - were showing that
            depending on external sources of happiness leads to less
            happiness in the long run.
            <br><br>
            Philosophers, scientists, and many spiritual traditions say
            that the real treasure lies within, so we realigned our
            compasses to a new north star - contentment.

            <span>Why are we here?</span>
            <br><br>
            <b>The Contentment Foundation</b> believes in a
            world where <i>happiness is cultivated from
            the inside out</i>. Not the other way around.
             We encourage people of all ages and backgrounds
             to simply draw their attention inside and discover
             for themselves the unconditional acceptance that has
             been there all along.
            <br><br>
            We are simply translators that are taking the best
            of our human philosophical legacy and interpreting
            it for the modern mind. We’re not reinventing the
            wellbeing wheel – we’re making the very basics
            accessible for everyone. We’re especially interested
            in creating opportunities for vulnerable populations
            of children and adults who could benefit the most
            from learning how to cultivate a sense of indestructible
            wellbeing.

            <span>Our Treasure Map</span>
            <br><br>
            <i>We believe that true happiness starts from within.</i>
            <br><br>
            The ideas that inspire us have been around for thousands
            of years and and are at the heart of most philosophical,
            spiritual, and scientific traditions searching for what
            it means to be unconditionally well. The Contentment
            Foundation is playing a role in translating some of the
            very basics from the heart of these traditions, testing
            them scientifically, and offering the core practices to
            children and adults who are interested in them.
            <br><br>
            We share humanity’s most effective wellness practices
            through our three branches – childhood education, adult
            development, and scientific research. We search for the
            place where science, philosophy, and human wellness meet -
            and therein lies the treasure that helps the modern mind
            turn inward. From there, we provide evidence-based practices
            that allow us to begin discovering that contentment has been
            there all along.
            <br><br>
            Simply put, we find some of humanity’s greatest treasures
            and offer an opportunity for you to begin exploring them.

            <span>What do we do?</span>
            <br><br>
            The Contentment Foundation offers child and
            adult-centered curricula, and studies the
            effects of contentment scientifically in
            partnership with some of the top universities
            in the world. The Contentment Foundation
            invites everyone to consider that true
            happiness already resides inside of you.
            <br><br>
            <span>The Bigger Picture</span>
            <br><br>
            There are many organizations focused on
            alleviating external poverty, a lack of
            essential resources like food, water, shelter,
            education, and safety. We are focused on alleviating
            internal poverty, a poverty of the mind, heart,
            and spirit. We help children and adults begin
            to cultivate a sense of internal and indestructible
            contentment that is not affected by the external world.
            Our service is to eliminate internal poverty worldwide
            by offering sustainable solutions toward experiencing
            unconditional acceptance, always.
